# GoValidate
The GoValidate Library provides a set of utilities and dynamic types to streamline data validation across different types while promoting code reuse and flexibility.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to simplify the process of validating data in Go applications by leveraging dynamic types. It allows developers to define and apply validation functions to various data types without duplicating code. Additionally, the library includes commonly used validation conditions out of the box, reducing the need for repetitive implementation.

# Features
* **Generic Types:** Utilize Go's generic capabilities to define validation structures (Validations) that can handle a wide range of data types.
* **Standardized Validation:** Define validation functions once and apply them to different data types using dynamic methods.
* **Common Validation Functions:** Includes pre-defined validation functions for common scenarios such as checking numeric ranges, string lengths, and format validations.
* **Flexibility:** Customize validation functions and easily extend functionality to suit specific application requirements.
